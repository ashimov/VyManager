"""
RBAC Permission System

Helper functions for checking user permissions based on the simplified RBAC system.

Permission Resolution:
1. Get all user's roles for the instance (from user_instance_roles table)
2. For each role, determine permissions:
   - Built-in roles (ADMIN, OPERATOR, VIEWER): Use predefined permissions
   - Custom roles: Look up permissions in feature_permissions table
3. Combine permissions (WRITE > READ > NONE)
4. Apply special rules (e.g., WRITE on CONFIGURATION requires READ on all features)
